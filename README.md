# Places_CNDS_models

Places-CNDS-8 is a "8conv3fc layer" deep Convolutional neural Networks model trained on MIT Places Dataset with Deep Supervision. 

Top-1 and Top-5 accuracies (%) on MIT Places Val/Test dataset:

       top-1 val/test        top-5 val/test
       54.7/55.7              84.1/85.8

The method is described in the following report.
